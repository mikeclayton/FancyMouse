/// <c>LayoutHelper.GetHostBoxStyle</c>), not something the preview pane's own layout needs to
/// know about. Deliberately excludes desktop position too - every bounds in

/// own top-left corner as the origin; deciding where that origin actually lands on the
/// desktop - centering on the activated location, clamping to the activated screen,
/// accounting for the host's own margin/border - is entirely the hosting window's job (see
